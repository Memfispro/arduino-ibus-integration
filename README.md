Integrating an Arduino Pro Micro into my BMW's I-Bus system

The main purpose of this project is receiving the I-Bus messages coming from the MFL steering wheel controller.
These messages are then converted to Alpine specific signals and HID commands for the connected Nexus 7.

Maybe there will be some "car-solution eLight" functionality as well, like DRL or coming-home leaving home.
